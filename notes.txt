Quality bottleneck: inharmonicity extraction

Bug fixes:
- During findPartials, was returning peaks whose samples number RELATIVE TO SEARCHWINDOW was closest to searchCenter's sample number, which is an absolute DFT-relative sample number. Fixed this.
- peaks' distances to searchCenter wasn't being computer correctly (lacking parentheses)

Issues:
Errors when finding partials' peaks in cases where peaks have conflicting amplitudes and distances from searchCenter.
How to distill amp and dist info in peak candidates to reliably return the correct partial?
  - metric combining dist and amp... confidence: amp/dist (plus scaling factors thrown in there)

Improvements:
Added multi-frame spectral averaging in whimsical "maybe-this'll work since Barbancho and Abesser did this", which suppressed LOTS of noise, unsurprisingly and amazingly.

Robustness of inharmonicity extraction heavily dependent on fine-tuning of parameters (min peak height, search window width, probably spectral averaging frame/hop/start size) with suspected different optimal values for different instruments

Techniques:
EM is a framework for finding the best descriptor of your data (min error, max likelihood) via iteratively
  (1) calculating the p.d.f., or expectation function, of your hidden variables using the current parameters (E-step), then
  (2) updating those parameters their MLE's to maximize the data probability (M-step)
  (3) repeat until convergence
