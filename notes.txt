Quality bottleneck: inharmonicity extraction

Bug fixes:
During findPartials, was returning peaks whose samples number RELATIVE TO SEARCHWINDOW was closest to searchCenter's sample number, which is an absolute DFT-relative sample number. Fixed this.

Issues:
Errors when finding partials' peaks in cases where peaks have conflicting amplitudes and distances from searchCenter.
How to distill amp and dist info in peak candidates to reliably return the correct partial?
  - enforce partial's sample must be >= last partials' sample
  - metric combining dist and amp... confidence = (A/B) * amp/dist.... closer distances give larger confidence, as do larger amplitudes... but how to tune...?
